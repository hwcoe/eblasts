UF CISE Recovery Update

Dear Alumni and Friends,

As we begin our recovery from COVID-19, I want to provide an update for you on the actions we undertook and that will take place at the University of Florida and within the Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering as we reopen campus to our faculty, staff and students. As always, our priority continues to be the health and safety of the UF community.

As I shared in the last newsletter, all of our spring classes were moved into a virtual environment as of March 13th, with our staff and faculty working remotely. The decision was made to deliver all classes online for the summer semester, and we have seen an increase in the number of student enrollments for this term. Further evidence of how well the transition has gone.

On June 23, UF President Kent Fuchs, Ph.D., presented the university’s recovery plan to the Florida Board of Governors. Our return to campus is predicated upon UF Health’s “Screen. Test. Protect.” program for employees and students. The university is committed the following:

* Face covering, physical distancing, and classroom design requirements to be determined by evolving guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UF Health. Current expectations are that face coverings are mandatory in all UF and UF Health facilities.

* CDC-approved cleaning protocols established for the maintenance of all UF facilities, including sanitizing stations widely deployed in facilities.

* On-campus residence halls will be open for fall, without an option for triple occupancy.

* University Athletics will comply with UF, NCAA and SEC standards to return employees and student-athletes and prepare for potential competition.

* Class sizes and delivery formats have been considered in all venues and the appropriate combination of online modalities, physical distancing, sanitation, masks, and other safety measures will be used. The primary goal is to assure that as many students as possible can make appropriate academic progress while minimizing the risk of a significant flare-up of COVID-19.

Since this crisis began, we have heard stories of how our alumni have stepped forward to help their local communities, friends and neighbors, as well as adapted their businesses to a new work model and even developed new products to make us safer. I want to especially thank those of you who were able to adapt summer internships for our students. Making internships possible through a virtual and remote environment gives them a chance to apply their knowledge and make valuable industry connections. If your company is currently hiring for internships or full-time positions, we hope you’ll consider joining us at the virtual Fall 2020 CISE Career Fair (https://careerfair.cise.ufl.edu/).

Others have asked how they can help as the COVID-19 crisis has created greater awareness about the needs of our students. For some students, Gainesville and the UF campus are the only safe places they can rely on to learn and live during the academic year. If you are able to help, please consider making a gift to the CISE Excellence Fund (https://www.uff.ufl.edu/giving-opportunities/000591-computer-and-information-science-and-engineering-excellence-fund/). This fund allows the department to immediately meet any need and unlock the potential in our students as they return to campus.

On behalf of the students, faculty and staff, I cannot thank you enough for all you have done and your continued support. We truly value our alumni, and we are thankful for your dedication to the department and UF.

Be well,
Juan E. Gilbert, Ph.D.
The Banks Family Preeminence Endowed Professor
CISE Department Chair
