UF CISE Professor Receives DARPA Grant: Professor Daisy Zhe Wang helps to bring order out of chaos with support from DARPA grant.

Professor Daisy Zhe Wang helps to bring order out of chaos with support from DARPA grant.  
Daisy Zhe Wang, an associate professor at the University of Florida Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, is collaborating with researchers at USCâ€™s Information Systems Institute (ISI), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Columbia University to shorten the time it takes intelligence analysts to collect and interpret data about national and international events. 

This research team led by ISI will use machine intelligence to collect all messages from different sources and will then construct a complete knowledge base with the extracted information.

With a $1.17 million grant from ISI/DARPA, Wang will develop computer algorithms that can answer a query by reasoning over an event-driven knowledge base and generating disparate hypotheses about the links between causes and effects for the event in question.
