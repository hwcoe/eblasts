UF CISE: Message from the Chair

Dear CISE friends and family,

I share in your pain and anger over the recent racist events against black lives that have taken place in our country. I stand with President Kent Fuchs (https://youtu.be/zUopSFGc93I) , Dean Cammy Abernathy (https://www.facebook.com/UFWertheim/posts/10158427099655135) , Dean Henry T. Frierson (http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/news/diversity-equity--inclusion-a-statement-about-current-events.html) and the entire Gator family in the condemnation of these racist, violent acts. The Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering has worked hard to increase diversity and equity in computing, but we can do more and are committed to continuing these efforts.

We value our differences, and we know that those differences make us stronger, better and define who we are collectively. The thought of such a violent act happening to anyone, but especially one of our CISE family members, is unbearable.

I am writing this statement in support of our CISE family, and I confirm our unwavering commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Please know that we are here for you.

Sincerely,
Juan E. Gilbert, Ph.D.
The Banks Family Preeminence Endowed Professor
CISE Department Chair
