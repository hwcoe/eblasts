Join us for a Gator Engineering reception in Melbourne

This year, as the world celebrates the 50th anniversary of the first man landing on the moon, we are reminded that it took 400,000 engineers and nearly $24 billion in the 1960s to meet the challenge.

With that same spirit, our engineering faculty, in multidisciplinary collaborations, are working today to solve the challenges of our own moonshots.

Dean Cammy R. Abernathy, Ph.D., and eight engineering department chairs will share key advancements at the college. We are confident that together, we will lead, design and build solutions for the society of the future.

“Today our concern must be with that future. For the world is changing...I believe that the times require imagination and courage and perseverance. I'm asking each of you to be pioneers towards that New Frontier.”
—John F. Kennedy
