RESEARCH & INNOVATION =======================================================


Fitz-Coy Funded by NASA and Air Force

Norman Fitz-Coy (MAE) was funded by NASA and the Air Force for a 5-year, $3M project to characterize the debris fragments from the DebriSat and DebrisLV laboratory hypervelocity impact (HVI) experiments. The research will generate critical data required to improve existing spacecraft breakup models used in the assessment and prediction of the orbital debris environment. The ability to accurately predict the orbital debris population in low earth orbit is one of the critical components in space traffic management.
