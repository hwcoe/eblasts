MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIR

As we navigate through the challenges of the current health crisis, I want to share with you some of the actions we have taken at the University of Florida Department of Chemical Engineering.

Our first priority is the health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff. As of March 13, all of our classes have been moved online, all staff and faculty members have transitioned to working remotely, and our labs and buildings have been secured. I am incredibly proud of how quickly our community worked together to make this happen.

We remain committed to providing the best possible chemical engineering education to our students and to solving society’s problems. I am proud to share some recent good news and highlights in this newsletter.

Warmest wishes,
Carlos Rinaldi, Ph.D.
ChE Department Chair and Dean's Leadership Professor
