									<p style="margin-top:0px;">A first hint of cooler weather and finally it feels like fall is really here. Welcome and welcome back! It was wonderful to see the Class of 2019 at Convocation. Their enthusiasm is contagious – I hope you savor it when you talk with any of them, our newest New Engineers. In case you missed the news over summer, some of our returning and recently graduated students have been stealing the national spotlight. Our concrete canoe and steel bridge teams made history when both won their respective competitions in the same year. Faculty made the news as well, with a list of awards and accomplishments. Read more below – and stay tuned! There are crowning moments yet to come...</p>
									<p style="margin-top:0px;">Thank you for your persistent hard work and dedication to the college. We have never been better positioned for success and I am confident that this will be a banner year for Gator Engineering.</p>
