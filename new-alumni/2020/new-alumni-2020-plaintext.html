GATOR ENGINEERS ARE NEEDED EVERYWHERE

Gator Engineers work, live and shape society in nearly every industry. More than 50,000 alumni from the UF Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering are transforming the future today.
 
We recognize that you are stepping out of your Alma Mater in a challenging time. Economic uncertainty, climate change, disease are not only discouraging issues that you need to overcome; more importantly, the world needs you to help solve them.
 
Cammy R. Abernathy, Dean of the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering, sums it up best: “Your generation is being tested, It may be daunting to think what lies ahead. In spite of all the worries, I’m optimistic about the future, because I’m optimistic about you. Don’t ever let fear extinguish that passion, or that confidence.”
 
We hope you'll stay connected as you make strides in your engineering career. Keep your contact information up-to-date as you move out into the world to make sure you receive our latest news and happenings, including spotlights on how members of this great class of new engineering alumni strengthen the lifeblood of the Gator Nation.
