LAST CHANCE: UF MSE Alumni & Friends Social - TMS San Diego

RSVP TODAY: https://ufl.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2sC6culgZOVxcO1

Join us February 24, 2020!

Last chance to join the University of Florida's Department of Materials Science & Engineering for our Alumni and Friends event in San Diego.

The event is held in conjunction with the 2020 TMS Annual Conference, but conference registration is not necessary to attend the social. At the moment we are currently finalizing the location, so please keep an eye out for our follow-up email containing those details.

This will be a great opportunity to mingle with faculty, students and fellow alumni over light refreshments. We also encourage you to bring up to two guests to join in the fun.

We look forward to seeing you in San Diego. 


GO GATORS!
