Along with the disruption to the department's day-to-day operations, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also led to an unprecedented urgency for student assistance. Thanks in large part to the on-going support of our friends and alumni we've addressed those concerns so far, but we also anticipate additional student needs in the coming months. Should you wish to help the department continue to address those needs, we invite you to visit the link below to help in any way. Thank You!
