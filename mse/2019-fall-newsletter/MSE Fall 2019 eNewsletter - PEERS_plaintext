UF MSE: Fall 2019 Newsletter

In 1959, Dr. Fred Rhines established the Department of Materials Science & Engineering at the University of Florida, making it one of the oldest in the country. It is also home to UF's Nuclear Engineering Program.

Each semester, the 1959 eNewsletter allows us to feature a few of our departmental updates and successes. We look forward to connecting with you!
