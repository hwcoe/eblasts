The latest news from UF’s Department of Materials Science & Engineering

It’s hard to believe how much has already happened in 2019 
In 1959, Dr. Fred Rhines established the Department of Materials Science & Engineering at the University of Florida, making it one of the oldest in the country. Today, the Department is ranked among the Top 10 public materials science and engineering programs in the nation.  The Department is also home to the No. 14 Nuclear Engineering Program among public universities. 

Each semester, you will receive a message from us highlighting departmental updates and successes. We look forward to connecting with you!
