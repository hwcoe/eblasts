SAVE THE DATE for the 2020 UF MSE Spring Banquet

We hope to see you next year.
With nearly 300 students, alumni, friends and family attending, the 2019 MSE Spring Banquet was one of our largest receptions in memory and also a huge success. Many thanks to all who were able to join us in both marking 60 years of the Department and celebrating the accomplishments of our students, faculty and staff.

Photos from the Banquet can be found here. e.g.: https://www.flickr.com/photos/157318842@N04/albums/72157704787602072

The 2020 MSE Spring Banquet is scheduled for Friday, April 17 so please mark your calendars.

GO GATORS!
