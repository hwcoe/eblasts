YOU'RE INVITED: UF NE Alumni Reunion with Special Guest Speaker and Host Nils Diaz, Ph.D.

RSVP TODAY: https://ufl.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cXWRJiM38g9bVKB

JOIN US IN CELEBRATING THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE OF THE UF NUCLEAR ENGINEERING PROGRAM
Nils Diaz, Ph.D. and the UF Department of Materials Science & Engineering invite you to attend a special day of both celebrating the history of the UF Nuclear Engineering program and looking ahead to its future.

There are three separate events scheduled for the day, beginning with a breakfast gathering in Rhines Hall. Dr. Diaz will then present a special seminar on Thursday afternoon, followed by a cocktail hour reception and dinner in the evening.

We also invite you to bring one additional attendee to join us.

Dear Colleagues,

I am convinced that there is now an opportunity to support the development and deployment of nuclear reactors with improved safety, reliability, cost-competitiveness and operations. We should support this new phase in all its aspects, including the establishment of university programs that fit the needs. I propose we start at our Alma Mater, the University of Florida.
