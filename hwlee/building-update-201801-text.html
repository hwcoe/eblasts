Herbert Wertheim Laboratory for Engineering Excellence: Recent updates on our flagship building


Dear %%First Name%%,
As we kick-off 2018, we are beginning to see the changing landscape of the Reitz Union Lawn as it makes way for the Herbert Wertheim Laboratory for Engineering Excellence. This flagship building will allow us to take experiential learning to new heights. Students will have flipped classrooms, a prototyping facility, and a state-of-the-art freshman design lab. 

It is because of your dedication to the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering and its students, that we are embarking on this project that will allow us to Power the New Engineer to Transform the Future. 

The Advancement team continues to work diligently to raise the final $4 million needed to complete the fundraising for the Herbert Wertheim Laboratory for Engineering Excellence to continue our momentum in the college's public/private partnership: The Wertheim Transformation. Dr. Forrest Masters, the Associate Dean for Research and Facilities, and I are also working closely with Cydney McGlothlin, Senior Project Manager, to stay up to date with all of the construction progress of the building. 

Below are some of the most recent updates:

	- Site utility work is underway and will be complete mid-February 2018.
	- Structural documents are currently in the bid process.
	- Final construction documents are due January 2018.
	- The upgrade of campus utilities around the building site is fully coordinated with UF Facilities Services. They are paying for roughly $5 million in infrastructure projects.

I would like to thank you again for your gift to the Herbert Wertheim Laboratory for Engineering Excellence. 

Without your generous support, the education, research, and innovation that takes place at the college would not be possible. We have ambitious goals to increase our faculty to 300 and double the college endowment to $178 million. Engineering is the catalyst for a changing world, and our partnership with you allows us to continue our advancement in engineering through the Wertheim Transformation. We look forward to providing you with more updates in the future as the project progresses. 

In the meantime, you can view the progress of the building by visiting https://www.senserasystems.com/public/project/ufwertheimlab.

Sincerely,

Cammy R. Abernathy,
Dean, Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering
