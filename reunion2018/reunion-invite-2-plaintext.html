Kicking Off the Alumni Reunion Challenge

=================================================================================
 
The Alumni Reunion Challenge focuses on supporting a key initiative that helps Power the New Engineer to Transform the Future. To kick off the inaugural year of this challenge, the college is supporting the STEPUP initiative.
 
STEPUP, which stands for the Successful Transition and Enhanced Preparation for Undergraduates Program, is a dedicated student success program focused on providing a diverse and inclusive learning environment for First-Year engineering students.
 
During registration for the Gator Engineering Alumni Reunion, you can join the challenge by making a contribution to STEPUP. Your gift, no matter the size, will be MATCHED by generous alumni up to $25,000, doubling the impact of your dollar.
