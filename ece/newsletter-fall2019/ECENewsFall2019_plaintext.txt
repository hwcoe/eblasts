ECE Florida News: Fall 2019

ECE Florida Research Expenditures at Record Highs

While we celebrate Team GatorWings' victory (see story below), we would be remiss if we didn't trumpet UF's national ranking—rising from #8 to #7 in the 2019 national rankings for public universities (US News & World Report). Governor Ron DeSantis came to Gainesville to announce the good news on Sept. 9.

ECE Florida research expenditures for Fiscal Year 2018-19 rose to $19M, the highest in our history and highest ever per faculty member (using the ASEE definition). These totals do not include the two new AFOSR Centers of Excellence that were just recently announced (see story below). These two centers focusing on hardware security are jointly administered with the Ohio State University.

Our faculty numbers are also at record highs. We are now at 54 tenured/tenure-track faculty, up from 41 five years ago, showing ECE is seen by the university as a good return on investment. Searches are ongoing for new faculty in electronics, machine learning and neural engineering. Our ultimate goal is to reach 60 tenured/tenure-track faculty members.

Please take the time to peruse the fall edition of ECE Florida News as we continue to showcase the work and successes of our faculty, students, and alumni. Go Gators!

Team GatorWings Takes First Place in DARPA SC2

Team GatorWings traveled to Los Angeles last week and, in the culmination of a three-year competition cycle, beat all comers to take first place in the final of the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2), taking home the $2M prize. In the preliminary rounds, Team GatorWings placed in the Top 10 in Phase I (earning $750K) and was then one of six winners in Phase II (earning an additional $750K), before being selected to participate in the final round.

Hardware Security Research and Education Centers of Excellence Open at UF and Ohio State University

The Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of Florida and The Ohio State University College of Engineering are collaborating as a close-knit team in two Centers of Excellence (COE) sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and Nimbis Inc., a developer of collaborative cloud communities. The centers' dual goals are to advance the area of hardware-enabled cybersecurity through innovation and development of new analog and mixed signal (AMS) domain security and to provide a comprehensive workforce training and education program in areas related to microelectronics design and security.

Dr. Mark Tehranipoor, the Intel Charles E. Young Preeminence Endowed Chair Professor in Cybersecurity and Director of the Florida Institute for Cybersecurity (FICS) Research, will serve as the co-director of both centers, along with Dr. Waleed Khalil from Ohio State.

Harley Uses Deep Learning to Understand Abnormal Grain Growth

Dr. Joel Harley is co-PI on a project that combines artificial intelligence and deep learning with materials and chemical science. The project, "Elucidating Grain Growth in Thermomagnetic Processed Materials with Transfer Learning and Reinforcement Learning," aims to combine deep learning with physics-driven models to elucidate one of the most fundamental, yet poorly understood, mechanisms in materials science: abnormal grain growth. A grain is small region of a material with the same crystal structure where all of the molecules are effectively aligned in the same direction.

The $1.2M project is part of a $27.6M DOE funding initiative for targeted research in data science to accelerate discovery in chemistry and material sciences.
