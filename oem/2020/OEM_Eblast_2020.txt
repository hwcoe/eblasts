Outreach Engineering Management Program

Are you interested in obtaining an engineering master's from UF?  The Outreach Engineering Management (OEM) Program includes graduate industrial & systems engineering and MBA courses, and is designed for working professionals.

UF's OEM Program provides students with the opportunity to obtain an engineering master's from a highly ranked university while simultaneously pursuing a career. The OEM Program provides an excellent alternative to an online degree program. Classes meet one weekend per month, allowing out-of-town students to participate in face-to-face meetings with faculty. Students progress through the program as a cohort, supporting further development of professional networks and awareness of employment opportunities. 
The OEM classroom experience includes engaging classroom discussions, team collaborations, and networking opportunities. Many employers will pay for a portion of course fees. The OEM Program awards a Master of Science in Industrial & Systems Engineering (engineering management track) but provides a blend of both industrial engineering and business courses. Student training applies to a broad range of disciplines and industries and can benefit technical professionals with almost any engineering or STEM background.

A new program begins
each August. 

Classes meet one weekend per month for 20 months.
Curriculum includes five engineering courses and five MBA courses.
Obtain an MBA with as few as 8 months of additional study.
Program fees are the same for Florida and non-Florida residents.
