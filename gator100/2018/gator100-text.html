Congratulations to Pinnacle Award winner Alex Moreno, CHE '83, and the other UF Engineering Gator100 Honorees.

Gator100 celebrates the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fastest Growing Gator Companies&rdquo; and recognizes UF Engineering alumnus and serial entrepreneur Alex Moreno with the Pinnacle Award.

Alex Moreno, CEO and cofounder of Nightingale Nurses, one of the largest healthcare staffing companies in the country with over 500 employees and revenues in excess of $60M, is no stranger to the Gator Nation. A Distinguished Alumnus of the Department of Chemical Engineering, frequent guest lecturer, and member of its external advisory board, he also created the Alex Moreno Endowed Professorship in Energy at the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering, providing a further boost to the college&rsquo;s new energy systems program. He is CEO and founder of Panther Development Investments, which provides diversified development services to Native American nations, particularly in areas of energy trading and investments.

Named after renowned local entrepreneur S. Clark Butler, the Pinnacle Award recognizes an established business leader who has shown sustained excellence and leadership and embodies the spirit of entrepreneurship much like Butler did. Neil Schopke, also a Gator Engineering alumnus, was named the 2017 Gator 100 Pinnacle Awardee. 

The Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering is proud to celebrate with Alex and all the other Gator Engineering entrepreneurs who are honored at this year&rsquo;s Gator100 (https://gator100.ufl.edu).

Gator100 is an annual celebration of the 100 fastest-growing Gator-owned or Gator-led businesses in the world. It is sponsored by the UF Alumni Association in partnership with the UF Entrepreneurship & Innovation Center.
