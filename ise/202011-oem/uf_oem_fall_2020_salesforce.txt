UF Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering
Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering
Outreach Engineering Management Program

UF's Outreach Engineering Management (OEM) Program is an innovative part-time engineering master's program that consists of industrial and systems engineering classes, together with MBA classes. The GRE is not required for the next cohort, which begins in August 2021.

EUF's OEM Program provides students with the opportunity to obtain an engineering master's degree from a highly ranked university while simultaneously pursuing a career. The OEM Program provides an excellent alternative to an online degree program. Classes meet one weekend per month, allowing out-of-town students to participate in face-to-face meetings with faculty. Students progress through the program as a cohort, supporting further development of professional networks and awareness of employment opportunities. 

The OEM classroom experience includes engaging discussions, team collaborations, and networking opportunities. Many employers will pay for a portion of course fees. The OEM Program awards a Master of Science in Industrial & Systems Engineering (engineering management track) and provides a blend of both industrial engineering and business courses. Student training applies to a broad range of disciplines and industries and can benefit technical professionals with almost any engineering or STEM background.

A new cohort begins each August. 

Classes meet one weekend per month for 20 months.
Curriculum includes five engineering courses and five MBA courses.
Obtain an MBA with only 12 more months of study.
Program fees are the same for Florida and non-Florida residents.
Due to COVID-19 impacts, the GRE requirements have been waived for the cohort starting August 2021.
