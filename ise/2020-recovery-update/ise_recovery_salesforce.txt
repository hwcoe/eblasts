UF Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering Recovery Update

Dear ISE Alumni:
 
I am reaching out to you today to share some of the preparations we are making to address the University of Florida’s plan for reopening and the transition of our department back to campus.
 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 13th, ISE began its migration to an online format for all department operations and teaching. Faculty and staff transitioned to remote work and teaching environments, leaving only essential personnel on campus. All course instruction became virtual in less than a week. At that time, we anticipated the effect of the virus to be limited to the Spring semester.
 
On June 23, UF President Kent Fuchs presented the University’s recovery plan to the Florida Board of Governors. This plan to return to campus was predicated upon UF Health’s “Screen, Test & Protect” program for all employees and students. The University and our Department is committed to the following actions as part of President Fuchs’ plan:
Face covering, physical distancing, and classroom design requirements to be determined by evolving guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UF Health. Current expectations are that face coverings are mandatory in all UF and UF Health facilities.
CDC-approved cleaning protocols established for the maintenance of all UF facilities, including sanitizing stations widely deployed in facilities.
On-campus residence halls will be open for fall, without an option for triple occupancy.
University Athletics will comply with UF, NCAA and SEC standards to return employees and student-athletes and prepare for potential competition.
Class sizes and delivery formats have been considered in all venues and the appropriate combination of online modalities, physical distancing, sanitation, masks, and other safety measures will be used. The primary goal is to assure that as many students as possible can make appropriate academic progress while minimizing the risk of a significant flare-up of COVID-19.
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have received accounts of how our ISE alumni have adapted to meet societal and business challenges posed by the virus. Gator Engineer-led companies have transitioned to the production of ventilators, masks, face shields, testing swabs and more. Our outstanding alumni have worked to aid their communities, including friends, neighbors and colleagues, through new business models to keep us safer in this new normal. Some other companies, including our ISE alums in managerial roles, adapted their summer internships for our students. I want to especially thank those of you who made internships possible through a virtual and remote environment to give our current students a chance to apply their knowledge and make valuable industry connections. If your company is currently hiring for internships or full-time positions, please visit our ISE Career Fair website to learn more about the ISE Fall 2020 Student Resume Database.
 
Beyond these corporate actions, still others have asked how they can help the department. For some of our students, the UF campus is the only place that they can count on for a conducive learning environment during the academic year. As many of you know, each year, the department awards substantial scholarships to both undergraduate and graduate students. If you are able and willing to help at this time, please consider making a gift to our ISE Excellence Fund. This fund allows the department to rapidly address student needs through various forms of support and to ensure that we unlock the potential in our students as they return to campus.
 
There is no doubt that the coming academic year will look much different than the previous years. Although this period in our history has been very challenging, I believe we will all emerge stronger and even more resilient as an academic department, university and nation. Our administration has worked tirelessly and has done a very thorough job of planning for operations under extreme circumstances. Complementing this plan, our alumni and friends have provided substantial support, as we continue to navigate the crisis. We cannot thank you enough for all you have done for the department and I know that all our students, staff and faculty are grateful. We look forward to your continuing engagement and dedication to the department as well as seeing everyone again in person in the future!
 
Please stay safe and healthy and, as always, GO GATORS!
 
Sincerely,

Dave Kaber
