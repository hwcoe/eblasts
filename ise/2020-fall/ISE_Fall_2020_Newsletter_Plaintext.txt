The Fall 2020 UF ISE Newsletter is Now Available

There is no question that COVID-19 and the world health crisis has placed tremendous demands and sacrifices on many of our friends and colleagues.

As we pivoted from our standard processes to a new normal, Iâ€™m proud of how everyone worked together. >>>: e.g.: https://www.ise.ufl.edu/newsletter-2020/
