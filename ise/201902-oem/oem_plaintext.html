Part-Time UF Engineering Management Masters

Are you interested in obtaining an engineering master's from UF?  The Outreach Engineering Management (OEM) Program includes graduate industrial & systems engineering and MBA courses, and is designed for working professionals.

UF's OEM Program provides students with the opportunity to obtain an engineering master's from a highly ranked university while simultaneously pursuing a career. The OEM Program provides an excellent alternative to an online degree program. Classes meet one weekend per month, allowing out-of-town students to participate in face-to-face meetings with faculty. Students progress through the program as a cohort, supporting further development of professional networks and awareness of employment opportunities. 
The OEM classroom experience includes engaging classroom discussions, team collaborations, and networking opportunities. Many employers will pay for a portion of course fees. The OEM Program awards a Master of Science in Industrial & Systems Engineering (engineering management track) but provides a blend of both industrial engineering and business courses. Student training applies to a broad range of disciplines and industries and can benefit technical professionals with almost any engineering or STEM background.

A new program begins each August. 
Classes meet one weekend per month for 20 months.
Curriculum includes five engineering courses and five MBA courses.
Obtain an MBA with only 12 months of additional study.
Program fees are the same for Florida and non-Florida residents.
