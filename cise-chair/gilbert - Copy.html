										<p>The University of Florida Department of Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE) has a new chair. Juan Gilbert, Ph.D., an expert in human centered computing, who currently occupies the Andrew Banks Family Preeminence Endowed Chair, will take the leadership position at the department.</p>
										<p>&ldquo;Computer science and engineering as a discipline has seen an unprecedented growth in the last few years,&rdquo; said Provost Joe Glover. &ldquo;Its significance in affecting all aspects of our lives cannot be emphasized more, from national defense to economic development to improving the wellbeing of the disabled. This is also reflected in the way UF’s <a href="http://ufpreeminence.org/focus-areas-3/">Preeminence Plan</a> has included CISE in a big way in terms of strategic focus and priority.&rdquo;	</p>
										<p>CISE has hired more faculty under the Preeminence initiative in the past year than many other units on campus. The department also saw steady advancement in performance metrics in the last three years, including grant dollars increase from $2.57M to $6.22M, increased student enrollment from 1,121 to 1,347, and most recently, becoming a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research.</p>
										<p>&ldquo;It is an exciting time for the college, without a doubt,&rdquo; said Cammy Abernathy, Ph.D., dean, College of Engineering. &ldquo;CISE can’t graduate enough bright students, mentor enough underrepresented minorities, accept enough qualified applications, and fill enough highly sought-after computer science positions. Virtually every sector in the country wants our graduates.&rdquo;	 </p>
										<p>Additionally, three faculty came with Dr. Gilbert to UF last July, each their own recognized expert in biometrics, virtual spatial audio, and K-12 level computer science education. They and more than a dozen doctoral students have since brought millions of dollars in federal grants to UF. The Human Centered Computing group, together with existing faculty and students, has garnered national attention for their <a href="http://www.myfoxorlando.com/story/28719219/uf-students-design-build-drone-controlled-by-human-thoughts">mind-controlled drones</a>, <a href="http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2014/10/technology-pioneered-by-uf-researcher-provides-improved-access-for-disabled-voters.html">accessible voting systems</a>, <a href="https://www.eng.ufl.edu/news/gator-engineering-startup-improves-nursing-education/">improved nursing education</a>, <a href="http://www.wndu.com/news/specialreports/headlines/Smart-house-concept-could-be-the-key-to-elderly-independence-287231841.html">senior-friendly &ldquo;smart houses,&rdquo;</a> and more. </p>
										<p>Aside from its research and teaching mission, the department is also helping UF fulfill its Land Grant promise. CISE provides workforce development with key industry partners such as <a href="http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2012/03/mindtree-to-bring-400-high-tech-jobs-to-the-gainesville-area.html">Mindtree</a>, Northrop Grumman and Harris Corp., and plays a key role in many statewide STEM-related economic initiatives, most notably the <a href="http://www.floridahightech.com/">Florida High Tech Corridor</a>.</p>
										<p>&ldquo;Northrop Grumman quote here.&rdquo;</p>
										<p>&ldquo;Without a doubt, what we need is a proven leader who is not only capable of riding this incredible tide, but is also someone who can steadfastly steer the department under this unstoppable momentum,&rdquo;	 added Dean Abernathy. </p>
										<p>Dr. Juan Gilbert was recruited from Clemson University last year. He was one of the first hires under UF’s Preeminence Plan, a move made possible by Andrew and Pamela Banks and their family’s $5M gift endowment to the university. Gilbert gained national recognition when the electronic voting interface that he created became the new standard for universal accessibility in elections after successful application in New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Oregon. Known as Prime III, it allows people with disabilities to cast their votes on the same system as everyone else. It took Gilbert and his team ten years to create and perfect Prime III, after which he gave it away for free, believing firmly that inclusion, empowerment and equality is the only way a society can move forward.</p>
										<p>&ldquo;I am motivated by social justice. It lets me see disenfranchisement in a certain way. Could we improve society (especially) now that we have the proliferation of computers? I say yes,&rdquo;	 said Dr. Gilbert. &ldquo;Computing is everywhere. It is pervasive.&rdquo;	</p>
										<p>Dr. Gilbert was previously a Presidential Endowed Chair in Computing and Chair of the Division of Human Centered Computing, School of Computing at Clemson University. He has been awarded more than $25M grant funding, mentored 70 graduate students and is the 2014 <a href="https://www.eng.ufl.edu/news/2014-aaas-mentor-award-winner-juan-gilbert/">AAAS Mentor Award</a>. He is also a recipient of the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awards/PAESMEM/recip_details.jsp?paesmem_id=224">2011 Presidential Award for STEM mentoring</a>.</p>
										<p>Dr Gilbert will be joined by My Thai and Tamer Kahveci, both Ph.D.s and Associate Professors at the department, as Associate Chair of Research and Associate Chair of Academic Affairs respectively.</p>
