Celebrating the Graduates from the Class of 2020 - Sponsor a Graduation Pin Today!
 
Today is the day to celebrate and acknowledge the accomplishments of all the graduates of the 2019-2020 academic year. We hope you will join us to support this annual tradition of investing in the next generation of biomedical engineers from the J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering.
 
“The BME department at the University of Florida is like a close-knit family. Receiving the BME graduation lapel pin further symbolizes the connection between all current and future graduating seniors and alumni. It also represents all our individual accomplishments that have been a catalyst to the medical and healthcare community. Together we celebrate that despite the different career paths that each one of us have taken, the pin will always be a reminder of the common goal we are all working toward.”
 
– Layan Hanouch, Class of 2020
 
“The BME graduation lapel pin is a reminder for both current and our newest alumni that they will forever be a member of the J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering Family. Together we celebrate this significant milestone for not only this accomplishment, but also knowing they will be the change agents to transform this world and continue to raise the significance of excellence in biomedical engineering education and exploration to progress the way we treat and advance human healthcare.”
 
– David Rojas, B.S. Class of 2019
