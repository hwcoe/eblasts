Today is the day, to celebrate and acknowledge the accomplishments of the class of 2019. We hope you will join us to support this annual tradition of investing in the next generation of biomedical engineers from the J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering.


Being an undergraduate student of the UF BME department has provided me with the skills and support needed to become a successful engineer with the ability to make meaningful impacts on my community. Graduating from the department will be the capstone of my time spent at the university, a place where I have been able to grow as a student and as a member of society. I will always be thankful for the J. Crayton Pruitt Department of Biomedical Engineering and will forever be a proud supporter of UF BME.
- Sean Marlon Te, Class of 2019


Your $100 contribution will directly impact current and future students of UF BME by funding important developmental programs and experiential learning outside of the classroom. Your generosity of $100 will provide BME 2019 graduates with their graduation lapel pin. We believe, your involvement will also encourage future graduates to support this tradition. All donors will receive a personalized note from a 2019 BME graduate to thank them for helping this celebration.
The pinning ceremony marked the transition to my professional career. This acknowledgment signified the need to take responsibility in giving back to the current students as others did in my development. I hope that this token serves as a reminder to celebrate your achievements and to continue to invest in those that are entering the exciting field of Biomedical Engineering.

- Brandon Reso, B.S/M.S.Class of 2016/2017

The BME graduation lapel pin is a reminder for both current and our newest alumni that they will forever be a member of the J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering Family. Together we celebrate this significant milestone for not only this accomplishment, but also knowing they will be the change agents to transform this world and continue to raise the significance of excellence in biomedical engineering education and exploration to progress the way we treat and advance human healthcare.
