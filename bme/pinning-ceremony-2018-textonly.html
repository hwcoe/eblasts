When you make the choice to support a BME graduate within the J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, you are joining a special annual tradition of investing in the next generation of engineers.

&ldquo;The pinning ceremony marks the end of the incredible journey that I have had as a biomedical engineering student at UF. The BME department has given me the opportunity to both succeed and fail, to explore my interests, and to develop into a leader that will eventually impact the global community. I am proud to be a graduate of the J. Crayton Pruitt Department of Biomedical Engineering and I am proud to represent UF BME for the rest of my life.&rdquo;

&ndash; Meggie Pires-Fernandes, Class of 2018

The graduation pin is a symbol that will stay with the Class of 2018 long after they walk across the stage. The pins recognize our graduating students for their achievements, and serve as a reminder of the importance of excellence in biomedical engineering education and research to improve human health.

With your simple gift of $100, you will provide a BME graduate with their pin and will contribute to a fund specifically dedicated to student activities and department programs that impact our students. Your participation will inspire future graduates so that they too might one day support this wonderful tradition. All donors will receive a personalized note from a 2018 BME graduate to thank them for supporting this special tradition.
